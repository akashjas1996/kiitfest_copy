                <p>Earlier, weights were lifted using pulleys, levers, block and tackles etc. These manual or mechanical methods of operation had several limitations. They also involved huge manpower and prolonged working hours for a peculiar job. As the population and technology increased exponentially, the demand for quicker and easier to operate equipment increased. To cater to this need, hydraulic machines were introduced.</p>
