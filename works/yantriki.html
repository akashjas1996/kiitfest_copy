                        types and creation of UAV will be demonstrated by Society Coordinators, an alumnus of KIIT
                        University and anex-member of APOGEIO would also be present as a guest lecturer. The
                        workshop would be all be technical and the participants are sure to learn and know all there is to
                        know about thebasics of drones and Avionics. At the end of the workshop, there’ll be a short
                        drone flying session inwhich trained pilots will fly the UAV and certificate distribution to the
                        participants. So overall it will be a technical workshop forthe aeronautical and avionics

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>Design a water rocket that is completely powered by the thrust delivered by water expelled at high
                        pressure along with its Launchpad.
                        Take your first big step to propel yourself into the world of aerodynamics!
                        Water Rocket is a mechanical event that involves the fabrication of a rocket whose fuel/thrust for
                        flight is obtained by the use of water that is expelled at a large air pressure. It is an example of
                        Newton's third law of motion. The pre requisites for such an event would be a basic knowledge of
                        fabrication, materials and physical calculations involving thrust, air pressure, etc. The event tests a
                        couple of aspects of the Rocket’s flight. These include range, time of flight and accuracy of the
                        launching mechanism.</p>
                        <h3>Objective</h3>
                        <h4>First round: Range test</h4>
                        <p>Here the maximum range is tested. The distance between the launch pad and the point of landing is
                        measured and taken to be the points in that round. From this, top 5 will be shortlisted for the next
                        round.</p>
                        <h4>Second round: Accuracy test</h4>
                        <p>At a distance of 70m from the launch pad, a target is placed. Target contains concentric circles of
                        radii 2m, 4m and 6m. If the rocket lands at the centre, team gets 100 points, second ring 75 points, and
                        outer ring 50 points. If otherwise, no points are awarded. Three&nbsp;teams will qualify for the final round.
                        In the case of any tie, the time of flight will be noted and the team with the least time gets into lead.</p>
                        <h3>Rules</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Max 5 participants. These Participants can be from different colleges too.</li>
                            <li>The rocket and its components must be handmade. No readymade rocket is allowed.</li>
                            <li>The rocket body should be made only with plastic bottles of aerated soft drinks of maximum capacity 2.5L and should be free of any fabrication failures or dents caused by heat exposure. More than one bottle can be used but the total volume must be less than 2.5L.</li>
                            <li>Each team MUST have their own launch pads.</li>
                            <li>The water rocket must use only compressed atmospheric air as its source of energy. Pressure compressors (foot pump) shall be provided at the venue. The pressure inside the container (rocket body) before launch should NOT exceed 60 psi for the first two rounds.</li>
                            <li>Water to be filled in the rockets will be provided by the organizers. Calculations regarding amount of water to be used is left to the choice of the team.</li>
                            <li><strong>Two</strong> trials will be given to each team and best of two will be taken into consideration.</li>
                            <li>The rocket must be launched from a stationary position using a fixed launch pad. Slingshots, trebuchets, catapults, cannons, and all other devices that may assist launching are strictly prohibited. IN other words, the internal pressure of the rocket must be the only source of energy for the rocket.</li>
                            <li>Water rockets can have multiple stages. Parachute, gliding mechanisms are permitted.</li>
                            <li>Use of electronic components and chemical explosives are banned.</li>
                            <li>The point where the rocket hits the ground first will be taken as the point of landing and measurements will be taken considering this point.</li>
                            <li>Teams are advised to get more than one water rocket, in case of any damage to one. But the water rockets must be identical.</li>
                            <li>The participants are allowed to use variations of their water rockets in different rounds. However, only one design must be maintained throughout a single round.</li>
                            <li>The team will be disqualified/given another chance to remodel if the model is found to be dangerous in anyway. Decision of the organizers is final and binding.</li>

                        <h3>Judging Criteria</h3>
                        <p>The judgment is completely based on the marking scheme mentioned in the event format.<br>
                        The organizers decide to permit the launching of the rocket after inspection of both the rocket and launch pad considering factors such as safety and permissible mechanisms mentioned in the rules. In such cases, the organizers’ decision is final and binding.</p>
                        <h3>F.A.Qs</h3>
                        <p>
                            1. Can school students participate as well?
                            Totally. No barriers at all.
                            2. What will be the pre-requisites?
                            Building a water rocket is both fun and quite an easy task. Basic designing and fundamentals in aero modelling would be sufficient.
                            3. Will launch pads be provided?
                            Not in any circumstance. The team has to deal with their launch pads in case if it gets damaged or broken.
                            4. Will any materials be provided on the spot?
                            The organization only provides water, a measuring cup, a bucket and compressors (which will have an in-built pressure gage). Other materials will NOT be provided. However, you could buy items in the stationary shops in the campus.
