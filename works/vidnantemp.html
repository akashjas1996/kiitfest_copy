                <h3>Task</h3>
                <p>Design and construct a remote controlled robot capable of fighting a one on one tournament.</p>
                <h3>Dimensions and Fabrications</h3>
                <p>1. The machine should fit in a box of dimension 400mm x 400mm x 400 mm (l x b x h) at any
                given point during the match. The external device used to control the machine or any
                external tank is not included in the size constraint.<br/>
                2. The machine should not exceed 20 kg but a tolerance of 10% will be allowed.
                Mobility: All robots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete.
                Methods of mobility include:<br/>
                1. Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot).<br/>
                2. Non-wheeled robots having no rolling elements in contact with the floor and any continuous
                rolling or cam operated motion in contact with the floor, either directly or via a linkage.
                Motion is "continuous" if continuous operation of the drive motor(s) produces continuous
                motion of the robot. Linear-actuated legs and novel non-wheeled drive systems come under
                this category.<br/>
                3. Jumping and hopping is not allowed.
                Flying (using air foil, helium balloons etc.) is not allowed.<br/>
                Requirements:<br/>
                1. The machine can be controlled through wired or wireless remote. In case of wireless remote
                Power supply should be on board only. Refer below for further details on battery and power.<br/>
                2. There should be binding capability between transmitters and receivers and they must
                connect between polycarbonate (6mm), metal bars barriers. The remotes with such facility
                will only be allowed.<br/>
                3. Nonstandard or self-made remote control systems must first be approved by the organizers.<br/>
                4. Team should pair up the wireless remote with the machine before putting it into the arena.</p>
                <h3>Battery and Power</h3>
                <p>1. The machine can be powered electrically only. Use of an IC engine in any form is not
                allowed. On-board batteries must be sealed, immobilized-electrolyte types (such as gel cells,
                lithium, NiCad, NiMH, or dry cells).<br/>
                2. The electric voltage between 2 points anywhere in the machine should not be more than
                36V DC at any point of time.<br/>
                3. All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a
                battery fire, failure to do so will cause direct disqualification.<br/>
                4. Use of damaged, non-leak proof batteries may lead to disqualification.<br/>
                5. Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries. If judges found that the
                battery is not properly protected, then team will be disqualified immediately.<br/>
                6. Change of battery will not be allowed during the match.<br/>
                7. It is suggested to have extra battery ready and charged up during competition so that on
                advancing to next level, you don’t have to wait or suffer due to uncharged battery. If teams
                don’t show up on allotted slot, they will be disqualified.<br/>

                Hydraulics:<br/>
                1. Robot can use non-inflammable liquid to actuate hydraulic devices e.g. cylinders.<br/>
                2. All hydraulic components on-board must be securely mounted. Special care must be taken
                while mounting pump, accumulator and armour to ensure that if ruptured direct fluid
                streams will not escape the robot.<br/>
                3. All hydraulic liquids are required to be non-corrosive and your device should be leak proof.<br/>
                4. Maximum allowed pressure is 12 bars.<br/>
                5. Participant must be able to indicate the used pressure with integrated or temporarily fitted
                pressure gauge.<br/>
                6. Entire hydraulic setup should be on board, no external input (from outside the arena) can be
                given to the robot for functioning of its hydraulic system.<br/>

                Weapons Systems:<br/>
                Robots can have any kind of cutters, flippers, saws, lifting devices, spinning hammers etc. as
                weapons with following exceptions and limitations:<br/>
                1. Liquid projectiles.<br/>
                2. Any kind of inflammable liquid.<br/>
                3. Flame-based weapons.</p>
                <h3>Criteria for Victory:</h3>
                <p>1. A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized.<br/>
                2. A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot display linear motion of at least one inch in a
                time period of 30 seconds. A bot with one side of its drivetrain disabled will not be counted
                out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement. In case both the robots
                remain mobile after the end of the round then the winner will be decided subjectively.<br/>
                3. A robot that is deemed unsafe by the judges after the match has begun will be disqualified
                and therefore declared the loser. The match will be immediately halted and the opponent
                will be awarded a win.<br/>
                4. If a robot is thrown out of the arena the match will stop immediately, and the robot still
                inside the arena will automatically be declared as the winner.<br/>
                5. Robots cannot win by pinning or lifting their opponents. Organizers will allow pinning or
                lifting fora maximum of 20 seconds per pin/lift then the attacker robot will be instructed to
                release the opponent. If, after being instructed to do so, the attacker is able to release but
                does not, their robot may be disqualified. If two or more robots become entangled or a
                crushing or gripping weapon is employed and becomes trapped within another robot, then
                the competitors should make the timekeeper aware, the fight should be stopped and the
                robots separated by the safest means.<br/>
                6. Points will be given on the basis of aggression, damage, control and strategy.<br/>
                7. Aggression – Aggression is judged by the frequency, severity, boldness and effectiveness of
                attacks deliberately initiated by the robot against its opponent. If a robot appears to have
                accidentally attacked an opponent, that act will not be considered Aggression.<br/>
                8. Control – Control means a robot is able to attack an opponent at its weakest point, use its
                Weapons in the most effective way, and minimize the damage caused by the opponent or its
                weapons.<br/>
                9. Damage – Through deliberate action, a robot either directly or indirectly reduces the
                functionality, effectiveness or defensibility of an opponent. Damage is not considered
                relevant if a robot inadvertently harms itself. Also, if a pressure vessel or a rapidly spinning
                device on a robot fragments, any damage to the opponent will not be considered
                "deliberate".<br/>
                10. Strategy – The robot exhibits a combat plan that exploits the robot's strengths against the
                weaknesses of its opponent. Strategy is also defined as a robot exhibiting a deliberate
                defence plan that guards its weaknesses against the strengths of the opponent. (NOTE:
                Qualification of a robot to next level be subjective and totally on the decision of the judges.
                A robot winning in a round against its opponent doesn’t guarantee its entrance into the next
                round. If the judges found the winner robot incompetent to enter into the next round, it
                may get disqualified. Judges can disqualify both the robots of a match from advancing to the
                next round. All the decisions taken by the judge will be final and binding to all. Any queries
                afterwards will not be entertained.)</p>

                Event Specific Terminologies:<br/>
                1. Disabled – A robot is not functioning correctly due to either an internal malfunction, or
                contact with the opposing robot or Arena Hazard.<br/>
                2. Disqualification – A Robot is no longer permitted to compete in the current Robowars
                Tournament.<br/>
                3. Immobilized – In Judge's opinion, a robot is not responsive for a specified period of time.<br/>
                4. Knockout – Occurs when the attack or deliberate actions of one robot causes its
                opponent to become immobilized.<br/>
                5. Lifting – Occurs when one robot controls an opponent's translational motion by lifting
                the drive mechanism of the opponent off of the Arena floor.<br/>
                6. No Contact – Occurs when neither robot makes contact with each other for a specified
                period of time.<br/>
                7. Pinning – Occurs when one robot, through sheer force, holds an opponent stationary in
                order to immobilize it.<br/>
                8. Radio Interference – Refers to the situation where at least one robot becomes non-
                Responsive or non-controllable due to the effect of the other robot's remote-control
                signal.<br/>
                9. Non-Responsive – In a Referee's opinion, the robot cannot display some kind of
                controlled translational movement along the Arena floor.<br/>
                10. Restart – Occurs after a Fault or a Timeout has been declared and the competing robots
                are ready to continue.<br/>
                11. Stuck – A robot is hung-up on a part of the Arena, an Arena Hazard or an opponent, such
                that it is effectively non-responsive.<br/>
                12. Tap-Out – Occurs when a Robot's Operators decide that they no longer want to continue
                the Match, and concede the win to the opposing Team.<br/>
                13. Technical Knockout – Occurs when a robot wins due to immobilization of its opponent
                even though, in the Judges' opinion, no action of the winning robot caused the
                opponent's immobilization.<br/>
                14. Timeout – A temporary halting of a Match. Timeouts are usually called to separate
                robots, but can be called for other reasons as well.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>There will a maze of 4.8m x 7.2m where bot will traverse. It will be manual
                controlled bot that can be wired or non-wired. The main aim is to gain
                maximum points by touching the blocks, placed randomly in the maze. A
                camera or a phone will be mounted over the bot, which will provide live feed
                fpv from bot. The controller will have to control it through the feed of camera;
                the arena will not be shown to the driver who is controlling the bot in the arena.</p>
                <h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
                <p>
                1. There will be a maze of wood with dimensions 4.8m x 7.2m<br/>
                2. Each participant have to start at a fixed position while traversing the maze<br/>
                3. There will be blocks placed in the maze at random positions.<br/>
                4. The points will be awarded on time basis and total number of blocks touched by the
                bot.<br/>
                5. Only one person per team will be allowed to manage the wire if any, while the event
                is going on.<br/>
                6. Teams with maximum points qualify for the next round.<br/>
                7. A team of max 4 participants is allowed.<br/>
                8. Any damage to the arena will result in direct disqualification.<br/>
                9. Round 2 will be notified to the qualifying participants.

                <h3>Bot Dimensions</h3>
                <p>
                    1. The bot should be having maximum dimensions of 20cm x 20cm x 30cm.<br/>
                    2. Max potential difference between any two points of bot must not exceed 16v. Only
                    220v AC would be provided. Participants would have to bring their own
                    adapter/battery etc.<br/>
                    3. Weight is to be limited to 3kgs.<br/>
                    4. Smaller and lighter the bot, better the chances of winning.<br/>
                    5. Robot must not contain any readymade kits or lego kits or any such assembly.<br/>
                    6. Team will not be allowed to change bots mechanism and parts once the game starts.<br/>
                    7. During the run, the bot should not damage the arena in any way. It is not allowed to
                    leave anything behind or make any marks while traversing. All machines found
                    damaging the arena will be disqualified.<br/>
                    8. Time measured by participants is not acceptable for scoring.<br/>
                    9. There may be slight variations in the dimensions of the arena.<br/>
                    10. Head on collisions with the arena would result in deduction of points.<br/>
                    11. The participants should bring at a minimum of 15m to 20m of wire because of the
                    big size of the arena.
