                Each team should have every necessary item which is to be needed for there bot to be played.<br/>
                BOT:- The bot shall be manually controlled and can be wired or wireless. The potential
                difference between any two points should not exceed 24V.<br/>
                i. Maximum size of the bot should not exceed 30cm*30cm*30cm (Strictly to be
                followed).<br/>
                ii. Bot weight should not exceed 3.5kg.<br/>
                iii. Expansion of the bot during the match is not allowed (Strictly to be followed).<br/>
                iv. Bot should be made properly, so that there should not be any harm in the Arena.<br/>
                v. No sticking or ball holding mechanism should not be present in the bot. Bot should
                only push or kick the ball (Strictly to be followed).<br/>
                vi. Power relay mechanism should not be used in connection as well as no mechanical
                gripers or Lego should be attached in the bots (Strictly to be followed).<br/>
                vii. The power supplies for the bot can be on-board or off-board.<br/>

                generated using natural forces such as gravity or flowing water. It's usually produced by
                dams, because dams can store and direct large volumes of water.</p>
                <h3>Rounds</h3>
                <p>ROUND 1:(MCQ ROUND)-This is the round where participants have to go through
                objective MCQ based questions on Hydro power plant.(elimination round).<br/>
                ROUND 2: (SEARCH & ASSEMBLE)-In this round participants have to find different
                components hidden across the campus. The teams at the end have to
                assemble the parts to form a model of a hydro power plant. The team to

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Electric vehicle is an emerging field and is a new challenge for engineers. This can bring
                about a revolutionary change in the vehicle industry. This event is about presenting thoughts
                and ideas (like energy sources, economic factor, efficiency, reliability etc.) related to electric
                vehicles and then depicting how these ideas can be implemented with a simple model. The
                purpose of this event is to show how electricity can be utilized to run vehicles in more
                efficient manner with no pollution and how this can be an alternative medium of transport for
                the world.
                </p>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <p><strong>ROUND 1</strong><br/>
                First round will be a power point presentation round. The participating groups will have to
                give presentation on “NEW IDEAS OF ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM AND
                MOTOR CHARACTERISTICS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE”.<br/>
                <strong>ROUND 2</strong><br/>
                In second round the participating groups will have to present MODEL description of new
                idea (like AutoCAD Model or any other Software Model). The Participating team can also
                present hardware prototype. (Team presenting Hardware prototype will be having an
                extra advantage)<br/>
                Note: - Team will have to explain their model with the help of presentation for both
                software and hardware model/prototype. No need to show whole vehicle prototype,
                team can use minimum required part to explain the prototype such as how energy
                conversion is taking place.</p>
