              <p><strong>EVENT DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
              <p>A cricket game which will be played in an arena completely enclosed by tight netting, a few metres from each side and end of the pitch. The pitch will be of same length as of normal cricket. The match will be played over 10 overs with a tennis ball. <strong>Teams will have to bring their own bats</strong>. It will be a knockout tournament.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>TECHNICAL:</strong></p>
              <p>&nbsp;Some programming keywords/lexemes&nbsp; will be glued on the fences like &lsquo;#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;&rsquo;,&rsquo;printf(&ldquo;Virat&rdquo;)&rsquo;,&rsquo;for(cricket=0;cricket&lt;=5;cricket++)&rsquo;,&rsquo;return result&rsquo;,etc and when the ball will hit those lexemes 2 bonus runs will be given to the batting side. Traditionally toss is decided by flipping a coin but here a C output question will be given, the team to solve first will win the toss.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>TEAM SIZE</strong>-8(6 players will be on the field and 2 will be a substitute)</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>RULES:</strong></p>
              <p>&nbsp; Backyard Cricket will have the same rules as the normal cricket except:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Bowlers can bowl maximum of 2 overs</li>
                <li>Batsman will be given out if the ball goes out of the arena</li>
                <li>The batsman will get runs by hitting the ball and running, hitting to different zones of the court(4 &amp; 6 runs possible)</li>
                <li>Bowler bowling a wide or a no ball will cost 2 runs</li>
                <li>No LBW dismissal will be there</li>
                <li>Overthrow will be there</li>
                <li>In case of a draw the match result will be decided by bowl out</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>SCORING:</strong></p>
              <p>Scoring in backyard cricket is split into 2 areas: physical runs and bonus runs. Physical runs will be scored by both batsmen completing from one crease to the other. Bonus runs will be scored when the ball hits a net. Bonus scores for particular parts of the nets follow:</p>
              <p>ZONE A (Back net-behind the bowler)-</p>
              <p>On the bounce 4 runs</p>
              <p>On the full 6 runs</p>
              <p>ZONE B (Front net-behind the keeper)-</p>
              <p>No runs</p>
              <p>ZONE C (side nets between the striker&rsquo;s end and halfway down the pitch)-</p>
              <p>On the bounce no run</p>
              <p>On the full 2 runs</p>
              <p>ZONE D (side nets between halfway and the bowler&rsquo;s end)-</p>
              <p>On the bounce 4 runs</p>
              <p>On the full 6 runs</p>
              <p>RESULT:</p>
              <p>The team with higher score at the conclusion of each innings will be declared the winner of the match.</p>
              <p>[<strong>NOTE-</strong> First 32 teams to register will be allowed to take part in this event]</p>

                <p>Earlier, weights were lifted using pulleys, levers, block and tackles etc. These manual or mechanical methods of operation had several limitations. They also involved huge manpower and prolonged working hours for a peculiar job. As the population and technology increased exponentially, the demand for quicker and easier to operate equipment increased. To cater to this need, hydraulic machines were introduced.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Design a water rocket that is completely powered by the thrust delivered by water expelled at high
                pressure along with its Launchpad.
                Take your first big step to propel yourself into the world of aerodynamics!
                Water Rocket is a mechanical event that involves the fabrication of a rocket whose fuel/thrust for
                flight is obtained by the use of water that is expelled at a large air pressure. It is an example of
                Newton&#39;s third law of motion. The pre requisites for such an event would be a basic knowledge of
                fabrication, materials and physical calculations involving thrust, air pressure, etc. The event tests a
                couple of aspects of the Rocket’s flight. These include range, time of flight and accuracy of the
                launching mechanism.</p>
                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <h4>First round: Range test</h4>
                <p>Here the maximum range is tested. The distance between the launch pad and the point of landing is
                measured and taken to be the points in that round. From this, top 5 will be shortlisted for the next
                round.</p>
                <h4>Second round: Accuracy test</h4>
                <p>At a distance of 70m from the launch pad, a target is placed. Target contains concentric circles of
                radii 2m, 4m and 6m. If the rocket lands at the centre, team gets 100 points, second ring 75 points, and
                outer ring 50 points. If otherwise, no points are awarded. Three teams will qualify for the final round.
                In the case of any tie, the time of flight will be noted and the team with the least time gets into lead.</p>
                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Max 5 participants. These Participants can be from different colleges too.</li>
                    <li>The rocket and its components must be handmade. No readymade rocket is allowed.</li>
                    <li>The rocket body should be made only with plastic bottles of aerated soft drinks of maximum capacity 2.5L and should be free of any fabrication failures or dents caused by heat exposure. More than one bottle can be used but the total volume must be less than 2.5L.</li>
                    <li>Each team MUST have their own launch pads.</li>
                    <li>The water rocket must use only compressed atmospheric air as its source of energy. Pressure compressors (foot pump) shall be provided at the venue. The pressure inside the container (rocket body) before launch should NOT exceed 60 psi for the first two rounds.</li>
                    <li>Water to be filled in the rockets will be provided by the organizers. Calculations regarding amount of water to be used is left to the choice of the team.</li>
                    <li><strong>Two</strong> trials will be given to each team and best of two will be taken into consideration.</li>
                    <li>The rocket must be launched from a stationary position using a fixed launch pad. Slingshots, trebuchets, catapults, cannons, and all other devices that may assist launching are strictly prohibited. IN other words, the internal pressure of the rocket must be the only source of energy for the rocket.</li>
                    <li>Water rockets can have multiple stages. Parachute, gliding mechanisms are permitted.</li>
                    <li>Use of electronic components and chemical explosives are banned.</li>
                    <li>The point where the rocket hits the ground first will be taken as the point of landing and measurements will be taken considering this point.</li>
                    <li>Teams are advised to get more than one water rocket, in case of any damage to one. But the water rockets must be identical.</li>
                    <li>The participants are allowed to use variations of their water rockets in different rounds. However, only one design must be maintained throughout a single round.</li>
                    <li>The team will be disqualified/given another chance to remodel if the model is found to be dangerous in anyway. Decision of the organizers is final and binding.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Judging Criteria</h3>
                <p>The judgment is completely based on the marking scheme mentioned in the event format.<br/>
                The organizers decide to permit the launching of the rocket after inspection of both the rocket and launch pad considering factors such as safety and permissible mechanisms mentioned in the rules. In such cases, the organizers’ decision is final and binding.</p>
                <h3>F.A.Qs</h3>
                <p>
                    1. Can school students participate as well?
                    Totally. No barriers at all.
                    2. What will be the pre-requisites?
                    Building a water rocket is both fun and quite an easy task. Basic designing and fundamentals in aero modelling would be sufficient.
                    3. Will launch pads be provided?
                    Not in any circumstance. The team has to deal with their launch pads in case if it gets damaged or broken.
                    4. Will any materials be provided on the spot?
                    The organization only provides water, a measuring cup, a bucket and compressors (which will have an in-built pressure gage). Other materials will NOT be provided. However, you could buy items in the stationary shops in the campus.

                <p>Water Rookie is a fun event for the participants. The event calls for a group having a maximum of 4 members.</p>
                <h3>Details: </h3>
                <p>It is a two-stage event:</p>
                <h4>Water Quidditch</h4>
                <p>Before the round starts, teams have to predict their scores (i.e. how many goals they can score)<br/>
                If the team score above the set target, 150 “Golden Snitch Bonus” will be awarded.<br/>
                If the set target is not achieved, the set score will be deducted from the total score.<br/>
                The minimum number of target score will be provided at the event location, in each round.</p>
                <p><strong>Team Score = Set Target &plusmn; Achieved Score</strong></p>
                <p>If the team gets the bonus<br/>
                <strong>Team Score = Set Target + (Achieved Score – Set Target) + Golden Snitch Bonus</strong></p>
                <h4>Tug of War in water</h4>
                <p>A rope marked at its middle, is to displaced from the decided centre point. The team with maximum displacement towards their side wins the set.<br/>
                If the rope gets displaced completely towards one team, that team will be considered as the winner of that set.<br/>

            </div>
            <div class="col-12 event-details text-justify">
                <h3>Task</h3>
                <p>Design and construct a remote controlled robot capable of fighting a one on one tournament.</p>
                <h3>Dimensions and Fabrications</h3>
                <p>1. The machine should fit in a box of dimension 400mm x 400mm x 400 mm (l x b x h) at any
                given point during the match. The external device used to control the machine or any
                external tank is not included in the size constraint.<br/>
                2. The machine should not exceed 20 kg but a tolerance of 10% will be allowed.
                Mobility: All robots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete.
                Methods of mobility include:<br/>
                1. Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot).<br/>
                2. Non-wheeled robots having no rolling elements in contact with the floor and any continuous
                rolling or cam operated motion in contact with the floor, either directly or via a linkage.
                Motion is "continuous" if continuous operation of the drive motor(s) produces continuous
                motion of the robot. Linear-actuated legs and novel non-wheeled drive systems come under
                this category.<br/>
                3. Jumping and hopping is not allowed.
                Flying (using air foil, helium balloons etc.) is not allowed.<br/>
                Requirements:<br/>
                1. The machine can be controlled through wired or wireless remote. In case of wireless remote
                Power supply should be on board only. Refer below for further details on battery and power.<br/>
                2. There should be binding capability between transmitters and receivers and they must
                connect between polycarbonate (6mm), metal bars barriers. The remotes with such facility
                will only be allowed.<br/>
                3. Nonstandard or self-made remote control systems must first be approved by the organizers.<br/>
                4. Team should pair up the wireless remote with the machine before putting it into the arena.</p>
                <h3>Battery and Power</h3>
                <p>1. The machine can be powered electrically only. Use of an IC engine in any form is not
                allowed. On-board batteries must be sealed, immobilized-electrolyte types (such as gel cells,
                lithium, NiCad, NiMH, or dry cells).<br/>
                2. The electric voltage between 2 points anywhere in the machine should not be more than
                36V DC at any point of time.<br/>
                3. All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a
                battery fire, failure to do so will cause direct disqualification.<br/>
                4. Use of damaged, non-leak proof batteries may lead to disqualification.<br/>
                5. Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries. If judges found that the
                battery is not properly protected, then team will be disqualified immediately.<br/>
                6. Change of battery will not be allowed during the match.<br/>
                7. It is suggested to have extra battery ready and charged up during competition so that on
                advancing to next level, you don’t have to wait or suffer due to uncharged battery. If teams
                don’t show up on allotted slot, they will be disqualified.<br/>

                Hydraulics:<br/>
                1. Robot can use non-inflammable liquid to actuate hydraulic devices e.g. cylinders.<br/>
                2. All hydraulic components on-board must be securely mounted. Special care must be taken
                while mounting pump, accumulator and armour to ensure that if ruptured direct fluid
                streams will not escape the robot.<br/>
                3. All hydraulic liquids are required to be non-corrosive and your device should be leak proof.<br/>
                4. Maximum allowed pressure is 12 bars.<br/>
                5. Participant must be able to indicate the used pressure with integrated or temporarily fitted
                pressure gauge.<br/>
                6. Entire hydraulic setup should be on board, no external input (from outside the arena) can be
                given to the robot for functioning of its hydraulic system.<br/>

                Weapons Systems:<br/>
                Robots can have any kind of cutters, flippers, saws, lifting devices, spinning hammers etc. as
                weapons with following exceptions and limitations:<br/>
                1. Liquid projectiles.<br/>
                2. Any kind of inflammable liquid.<br/>
                3. Flame-based weapons.</p>
                <h3>Criteria for Victory:</h3>
                <p>1. A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized.<br/>
                2. A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot display linear motion of at least one inch in a
                time period of 30 seconds. A bot with one side of its drivetrain disabled will not be counted
                out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement. In case both the robots
                remain mobile after the end of the round then the winner will be decided subjectively.<br/>
                3. A robot that is deemed unsafe by the judges after the match has begun will be disqualified
                and therefore declared the loser. The match will be immediately halted and the opponent
                will be awarded a win.<br/>
                4. If a robot is thrown out of the arena the match will stop immediately, and the robot still
                inside the arena will automatically be declared as the winner.<br/>
                5. Robots cannot win by pinning or lifting their opponents. Organizers will allow pinning or
                lifting fora maximum of 20 seconds per pin/lift then the attacker robot will be instructed to
                release the opponent. If, after being instructed to do so, the attacker is able to release but
                does not, their robot may be disqualified. If two or more robots become entangled or a
                crushing or gripping weapon is employed and becomes trapped within another robot, then
                the competitors should make the timekeeper aware, the fight should be stopped and the
                robots separated by the safest means.<br/>
                6. Points will be given on the basis of aggression, damage, control and strategy.<br/>
                7. Aggression – Aggression is judged by the frequency, severity, boldness and effectiveness of
                attacks deliberately initiated by the robot against its opponent. If a robot appears to have
                accidentally attacked an opponent, that act will not be considered Aggression.<br/>
                8. Control – Control means a robot is able to attack an opponent at its weakest point, use its
                Weapons in the most effective way, and minimize the damage caused by the opponent or its
                weapons.<br/>
                9. Damage – Through deliberate action, a robot either directly or indirectly reduces the
                functionality, effectiveness or defensibility of an opponent. Damage is not considered
                relevant if a robot inadvertently harms itself. Also, if a pressure vessel or a rapidly spinning
                device on a robot fragments, any damage to the opponent will not be considered
                "deliberate".<br/>
                10. Strategy – The robot exhibits a combat plan that exploits the robot's strengths against the
                weaknesses of its opponent. Strategy is also defined as a robot exhibiting a deliberate
                defence plan that guards its weaknesses against the strengths of the opponent. (NOTE:
                Qualification of a robot to next level be subjective and totally on the decision of the judges.
                A robot winning in a round against its opponent doesn’t guarantee its entrance into the next
                round. If the judges found the winner robot incompetent to enter into the next round, it
                may get disqualified. Judges can disqualify both the robots of a match from advancing to the
                next round. All the decisions taken by the judge will be final and binding to all. Any queries
                afterwards will not be entertained.)</p>
                <h3>Team Specification:</h3>
                <p>1. Any team can participate in Robowars, KIITfest. A team may consist of a maximum of 5
                participants. These participants can be from same institute.<br/>
                2. Team Name: Every team must have a name which must be unique. KIITfest reserves the
                right to reject entries from any Team whose name it deems inappropriate, offensive or
                conflicting. Organizers must be notified during if a Team's name has been changed.<br/>
                3. Team Representative: Each team must specify their Team Representative (Leader) at the
                time of registration. All-important communications between KIITfest team members and the
                registered teams will be done through their Team Representative. The Team representatives
                must submit valid contact details (phone no., email ID etc.) at the time of registration.
                (NOTE: During any kind of conversation, registration, communication, mails or submissions
                the team must identify themselves by their Team ID only provided at the time of registration
                and not by your team name. Please do not use your team name as your identification in any
                kind of communication with us. Follow this rule very strictly.)
                Event Specific Terminologies:<br/>
                1. Disabled – A robot is not functioning correctly due to either an internal malfunction, or
                contact with the opposing robot or Arena Hazard.<br/>
                2. Disqualification – A Robot is no longer permitted to compete in the current Robowars
                Tournament.<br/>
                3. Immobilized – In Judge's opinion, a robot is not responsive for a specified period of time.<br/>
                4. Knockout – Occurs when the attack or deliberate actions of one robot causes its
                opponent to become immobilized.<br/>
                5. Lifting – Occurs when one robot controls an opponent's translational motion by lifting
                the drive mechanism of the opponent off of the Arena floor.<br/>
                6. No Contact – Occurs when neither robot makes contact with each other for a specified
                period of time.<br/>
                7. Pinning – Occurs when one robot, through sheer force, holds an opponent stationary in
                order to immobilize it.<br/>
                8. Radio Interference – Refers to the situation where at least one robot becomes non-
                Responsive or non-controllable due to the effect of the other robot's remote-control
                signal.<br/>
                9. Non-Responsive – In a Referee's opinion, the robot cannot display some kind of
                controlled translational movement along the Arena floor.<br/>
                10. Restart – Occurs after a Fault or a Timeout has been declared and the competing robots
                are ready to continue.<br/>
                11. Stuck – A robot is hung-up on a part of the Arena, an Arena Hazard or an opponent, such
                that it is effectively non-responsive.<br/>
                12. Tap-Out – Occurs when a Robot's Operators decide that they no longer want to continue
                the Match, and concede the win to the opposing Team.<br/>
                13. Technical Knockout – Occurs when a robot wins due to immobilization of its opponent
                even though, in the Judges' opinion, no action of the winning robot caused the
                opponent's immobilization.<br/>
                14. Timeout – A temporary halting of a Match. Timeouts are usually called to separate
                robots, but can be called for other reasons as well.</p>

                <h3>Guidelines for Round 2</h3>
                <p>1. The presentation should no longer than 8 minutes.<br/>
                2. The following is a recommended outline for an 8 minute Best Practice Competition
                presentation:<br/>
                i. Slide No.1 – Topic of the Team/Solo.<br/>
                ii. Slide No.2 – Brief idea about the topic.<br/>
                iii. Slide No.3 – Describing each and every point in depth .<br/>
                iv. Slide No.4 – Any alternate methods.<br/>
                3. For the Best Practice Competition your written entry and presentation will be assessed
                on the following criteria.<br/>
                i. Level of deployment<br/>
                ii. Level of innovation<br/>
                iii. Results achieved<br/>
                iv. Evidence it is a best practice (use of benchmarking/comparison of results/peer
                reviewed)<br/>
                v. Review/next steps planned<br/>
                4. Include photographs or videos in your presentation to help you to explain your best
                practices. Pictures are worth a 1000 words.<br/>
                5. During your presentation, talk clearly and smoothly. Clarity is of the essence.
                Presenters with English as their mother tongue and a fast mode of speaking should
                think of other people in the audience whose mother tongue may not be English since
                this is an international event.<br/>
                6. Rehearse well even if you are an experienced presenter. Your audience is
                sophisticated, thus, reading from slides during a presentation is deemed
                unprofessional.</p>

                <h3>Premise</h3>
                <p>The fictional Victor Frankenstein once created a monster called Frankenstein, it however did not turn out very well. But modern science has come a long way today. Emerging areas of science such as Synthetic Biology, Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology can now turn fiction into reality, thereby allowing mankind to create their own organism - one which will definitely not turn out to be a brute monster!</p>
                <p>The search for extraterrestrial life is undoubtedly one of the most attractive topics in science. With the growing understanding of environment on Mars, it is believed that in the future affordable space transportation and colonisation of Mars will be possible. Using creative thinking and your knowledge of science, ideate and design an hypothetical life form - an organism that will be capable of life suited for specific environmental conditions on the planet Mars.</p>

            <div class="col-12 event-details text-justify">
              <h3><strong><u>Event Details</u></strong></h3>
              <p><strong>Futsal</strong>&nbsp;is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used.</p>
              <p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
              <p><strong><u>Rules </u></strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>20-minute periods</strong><br /> Futsal matches comprise two periods each lasting 20 minutes of actual playing time. The clock is stopped every time the ball goes out of play and is restarted when play resumes.</li>
                <li><strong>Time outs</strong><br /> Teams are entitled to a one-minute time-out in each period. A team that does not request a time-out in the ﬁrst half of the match is only entitled to one time-out during the second half. There are no time-outs in extra time.</li>
                <li><strong>Unlimited substitutions</strong><br /> A match is played by two teams, each consisting of not more than ﬁve players (a goalkeeper and four outfield players) and nine substitutes. There is no restriction on the number of substitutions that may be made during a match. Substitutions may be made at any time, whether the ball is in play or not, but only in the specially demarcated substitution zones.</li>
                <li><strong>Replacement of sent-off players</strong><br /> A substitute player may replace a sent-off player and enter the pitch two full minutes after the sending-off. They may, however, enter the pitch before the two minutes have elapsed should their team concede a goal while a player down.</li>
                <li><strong>The goalkeepers</strong><br /> Goalkeepers have only four seconds in which to play the ball, with either their hands or feet, and may not touch it again if it has been deliberately played to them by a team-mate without an opponent playing or touching it. Goalkeepers are also now&nbsp;free to play anywhere on the pitch and throw the ball beyond the halfway line, which was not previously permitted.</li>
                <li><strong>Accumulated fouls and the second penalty mark</strong><br /> Accumulated fouls are those penalised with a direct free-kick or penalty kick, regardless of whether advantage has been played or not. If a team commits a sixth accumulated foul, the opposing side may take the subsequent free-kick awarded to them without a wall, either from the second penalty mark, which is positioned four metres behind the first, or from a position even closer to the penalty area if the foul was committed between the goal line and the second penalty mark.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
              <p>Unlike 11-a-side football, goals may not be scored directly from the kick-off in futsal and there is no offside.</p>
