   <h1>SEGUIDOR</h1>
   <p> Design and construct an autonomous robot which is capable of traversing the arena by following a line in a particular manner and avoid the obstacle that it might encounter. The participants are required to build a line following bot which is capable of detecting an obstacle in front of it and sense the presence of colour on the floor in front of it. </p>
   <p> TASK: Traverse the area from the START point to the END point by following a black line laid throughout the white area. But the task is not that simple. The bot should be capable of following a particular pattern as mentioned further in this problem statement. The bot should work on the principle of advance line follower to give utmost efficiency on the arena. During its operation, the bot will encounter the various obstacle which it needs to understand and take action accordingly. Performing every task smoothly will result in full point and violating it will result in penalties.</p>
   <p> <b> ARENA DESIGN & SPECIFICATION: </b> </p>
   <ol>
      <li> The arena will be absolutely flat and levelled out so additional power is not required to run the bot. Although participants can vary the speed of their robot to give maximum efficiency in following the line.</li>
      <li> The Surface of the arena will be painted white and the bot is required to follow a black line of thickness 2 centimetres.</li>
   </ol>
   <p> <b> KEY POINTS: </b> </p>
   <p> There are some key points of the arena that the participants need to keep in mind while programming their bot to gain maximum points and avoid deviation from the required path. </p>
   <p> At some point in the area, the black line will not be continuous and there will be a gap of not more than 5 centimetres. There will also be a sharp turn after some gaps. So the participants should program their bot in such a way that it does not malfunction at these given points. According to the given figure, the bot should follow the line as the blue line suggest.</p>
   <p> As the image suggests, at some point of the arena the line shift suddenly to either the right or left by not more than 1 centimetre. The participant needs to program their bot in such a manner that it could understand the shift and traverse the path according to the blue line shown in the image.</p>
   At some points of the arena, the lines will have sharp turns but the edges of the turn will be removed as you can see in the image beside. So the participant needs to program their bot in such a way that it does not malfunction in this part.
   At some points of the arena, the path could have a turn with an angle of at most 45 degrees. So the participants will have to program their bot accordingly. If the bot leaves the path, it will have to restart from the last checkpoint and penalties will be imposed for every such action.
   Some part of the arena will constitute curved dotted lines with gaps of a maximum of 1 centimetre. The line will not bend with a very sharp turn but will almost look like a straight line. So the contestant need not worry so much about this part as they will easily be able to traverse with a minor change in the program.
   <p> <b> COLOUR SENSING:</b></p>
   <p>There will be points in the arena where the line will divert into two paths at 90 degrees. At this point, there will a rectangular patch of red colour laid on the floor 3 cm ahead of the turning point as shown in the diagram. The participant needs to construct their bot and program it in such a manner that it should be able to detect this colour in front of the line and take 90 degrees turn to the left side. Taking a right turn in this point and following the path will result in negative points. If the left path is traversed, the team will gain points in their favour.</p>
   <p>There will be points in the arena where the line will divert into two paths at 90 degrees. At this point, there will a rectangular patch of yellow colour laid on the floor 3 cm ahead of the turning point as shown in the diagram. The participant needs to construct their bot and program it in such a manner that it should be able to detect this colour in front of the line and take 90 degrees right turn. Taking a left turn in this point and following the path will result in negative points. If the right path is traversed, the team will gain points in their favour.</p>
   <p> When patches of blue colour will be present on the floor in front of the line the bot should take a 180 degrees turn clockwise or anticlockwise and follow the path backwards and take another left turn to follow the right path. Skipping the blue patch and following the wrong path will result in negative marking. </p>
   <p> According to the given figure, at some point in the arena, there will be no line to follow. Instead, there will be a wall in front. The participant will have to construct their bot in such a way that it should detect the wall in front of it and take a 90 degree turn to the right and continue to detect a line again. If the bot is not able to detect the wall in front of it or it is deviating from its required path, then it will have to take a restart and start from the last checkpoint with penalties. </p>
   <p> The Arena will contain various checkpoints, completing which will result in additional points. After any checkpoint, if the bot deviates from its path, then the bot will start its journey from the last checkpoint. </p>
   • The contestant will need to program their bot so that it is capable of turning clockwise or counter-clockwise at exactly at the angle required at each key points of the arena. Failing which will result in negative marking.
   <p> <b> ROBOT SPECIFICATIONS: </b></p>
   <p>
   <ol>
      <li> A robot must not contain any readymade kits or Lego kits or any such assembly.
      <li> However readymade microcontroller boards, sensors, chassis, gears and shafts may be used.
      <li> The voltage difference between any two points on bot must not exceed 24 volts.
      <li> The robot dimension must be limited by 20cm x 20cm x 20cm.
      <li> The robot must be completely autonomous. - It should not receive any input from outside the arena.
      <li> The robot should not contain more than 6 IR sensors for fair competition.
      <li>
         Motor RPM should not exceed 200. </li></ol>

   <ol>
   <li> PRELIMS: </li>
   <ul>
   <li>Prelims will contain only some key points of the problem statement and the participant ability to build a perfect line follower will be tested. This will a qualifying round in which contestant will compete for each other to qualify for the finals and get yourself one step closer to the winning prize!!
   <li>Two dry runs of 8 minutes will be given followed by one final run of 5 minutes. The dry run will help the participant anticipate any change in the program that they might need to do to make their bot more perfect (Any change in the construction is not allowed). But they cannot take more than 5 minutes or leave the arena during their dry and final run, otherwise, the team will be disqualified.
   <li>The score of the only final run will decide if the participant qualifies in the next round or not. And only one final run will be made and the scoring will be final under every circumstance.
   <li>If the bot deviates from the path, it will have to start again from the last checkpoint. Three such restarts will be allowed, after that negative mark will be imposed on them.
   <li>For completion of every checkpoint, there will be positive making.
   <li>Completing the whole path of the prelim will result in additional points other than the checkpoint.
   <li>Skipping is not allowed in the prelims.</li></ul>
    <p> <li>FINALS:</li> </p>
    <ul>
   <p> <li>Finals will contain all the key points of the problem statement. This is where it will get really interesting. The Actual coding skill and teamwork of the participant will be tested and the challenges will not be as easy as the prelims.</li>

Thus battling with the opponents based on Marginal points and timing to finally win it. The bot can be wired or wireless. In case of wireless they maybe Bluetooth controlled or Wi-Fi controlled. There are 2 rounds, Round 1 and 2 based on the difficulty level, participants will go to the next round by only clearing the preceding round. </p>
<p> <b>  Round1 (Two bots will have to compete for each other in a race.) </b> </p>
 <p> <b> Gameplay 1: </b> </p>
 Two bots must start from the “START” mark.  
The bots first arrive at Checkpoint A.
 The two bots have to reach Checkpoint B after crossing the hurdles in any of the two paths. (Additional points for a difficult path.) 
 Then the bots will move towards the Checkpoint C after crossing the typical curvature.
  Then the bots will have to climb a special obstacle to reach Checkpoint D. 
 Checkpoint E will be obtained after overcoming the Staircase(ie.an escalator moving in the opposite direction). Then the bots have to go through the Roller section to reach the ‘FINISH’ MARK.
<p> <b>  Round2: </b> </p>
 <p> <b>  Gameplay 2:- </b> </p>
 It is a solo race; In addition to the previous Checkpoints in ROUND 1 the new Checkpoints are as follows:-
 The bot must start from the ‘START’ mark. 
 The bot will reach Checkpoint *A after avoiding the obstacles.
 The bot arrives at Checkpoint *B after going through the tunnel. 
 Checkpoint *C will be obtained after overcoming the Roller section with an additional obstacle. 
 The bot will have to choose either of the two paths to reach the Checkpoint *D or Checkpoint *E respectively and finally reach the ‘FINISH’ MARK.

<li> 5 points for reaching Checkpoint *A. </li>
<li> 15 points for reaching Checkpoint *B. </li>
<li> 5 points for reaching Checkpoint *C. </li>
<li> 20 points for reaching Checkpoint *D or 10 points for reaching Checkpoint *D.</li> 
<li> Bots may be judged for full completion and quickness of completion based on performance and development of the bot.</li>
<li> Any change in the scoring and judgment criteria may be done by the Organizers without prior announcement if some issue arises.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b> Penalties:- </b> </p>
<li> Participants may skip an obstacle but will result in -10points. (Only one skip is allowed in the entire race.) </li>
<li> 10 points for going out of the arena. </li>

<h1> MIRROR MAZE 2.0 </h1>
<p> <b> Description: </b> </p>
<p> 
 There will be a maze of size 11x17 sq.ft. where the bot will traverse. The walls will be made of glass and mirrors. It will be a manually controlled bot that can be wired or wireless. The goal is to gather maximum points by touching the blocks, placed randomly across the maze. A camera or a phone should be mounted over the bot, which will provide a live feed fpv from bot. The driver will have to control it through the camera screen as the arena will not be shown to the driver who is controlling the bot. Obstacles like speed breakers, bumps and fluid patches would be present in the arena. The depth of fluid patch would be 2 cm from ground level. So all electrical connections of the bot must be designed accordingly.</p>
<p> <b> Requirements of the bot: </b> </p>
<li> Dimensions of the bot must not exceed 20x20x20 cubic.cm. </li>
<li> All connections of the bot must be minimum of 3-4 cm above the ground level. </li>
<li> Max potential difference between any two points of bot must not exceed 16v. Only 220v AC would be provided. Participants would have to bring their own adapter/battery etc. </li>
<li> No weight criteria. </li>
<li> The camera or mobile phone must be tightly fixed in order to prevent detachment.</li>
<p> <b> Rules and Regulations:- </b> </p>
<li> Maze dimension will be (11x17) sq.ft. </li>
<li> A team of max. 4 participants is allowed. </li>
<li> The event consists of ......... rounds.</li>
 <li> Each team can avail for only 1 technical time-out per round. 
<li> The maze obstacles consist of speed breakers, bumps and may be fluid patches along with few other common obstacles. </li>
<li> Each participant has to start at a fixed position to traverse the maze. </li>
<li> Wooden blocks of certain points would be placed at random positions in the maze before a team start their turn (Red block= 5 points, Blue block= 10 points, Yellow block= 30 points, Jackpot block= 100 points).</li>
 <li> The points will be awarded on a time basis and a total number of blocks touched by the bot.</li> 
<li> Only one person per team will be allowed to manage the wire (only if the bot is wired) & only one would be allowed to control the bot. The other members would be sitting by the controller facing their laptops thereby seeing the live feed. The person managing the wire is strictly prohibited to convey any information regarding the layout & position of point blocks. Anyone doing the same will be disqualified from the event.</li>
<li> The controller would be allowed 30 seconds just before the start of their turn to observe the maze & positions of the point blocks. </li>
<li> Any damage to the arena will result in direct disqualification. </li>
<li> Teams with maximum points qualify for the next round.</li>
<li> Each team gets 3 skip options. It can only be applied when a bot is unable to cross any obstacle or if the controller wishes to skip the obstacle (No negative markings in such criteria). Special case: In case the controller wishes to skip the water(or non-Newtonian fluid) patch 10 points would be deducted from the total score. Any damage to the bot caused while crossing this patch is solely the team’s responsibility. </li>
<li> However, this skip option is not available in the jackpot region.</li>
 <li> Touching the glass wall results in a negative marking of 2 marks. </li>
<li> Further rules of qualifying rounds would be disclosed on spot. </li>
<li> The organiser’s decision is final and binding</li>

<p> <b> Judging Criteria: </b> </p>
<li> A trial case of 50 seconds will be allowed to individual teams to check the maze.</li>
<li> A participant can avail maximum up to 3 skips per round, which can be opted only if the bot freezes on spot. For each skip, 5 marks would be deducted.</li>
<li> All teams would be awarded 50 points initially only if it satisfies the dimension criteria.</li>
<li> A tolerance of 20cm + 4cm (bot width) will be allowed for participating in the event, however, the team would lose the initial 50 points in that case.</li>
<li> There would be a total of 3 rounds: <Round 1> Individual teams would be participating one by one & the top teams scoring the most points in the specified time for the round will get qualified for the next round. 

    <p> <b> Round 2  : </b> Two bots would be participating simultaneously from 2 random extreme points in the maze. The bot securing most points in the given time span of the round qualifies for the next round. An addition of 20 points would be awarded if the bot exits the maze in the given time span. <p> <b> Round 3 :  </b> Will be disclosed on spot. </p>
<p> <ul> <li> Ramming of the wall (by a bot or by the participant) would directly result in a deduction of 10 marks. </li>
<li> Each team is allowed only 1 technical timeout per round and this rule is applicable only if the coordinators find the case to be relevant. </li>
<li> All rules & marking schemes are subjected to change before the starting of competition. </li>
<li> Detailed marking scheme would be disclosed to the participants just before the commencement of the event. </li> </ul>
