            <p><b>Description of Event:</b></p>
            <p>Since it’s inception in 2016, KIIT-IEEE student branch council has been organising seminar workshop and seminar on various trending domain in the fields of technology. This year is no different. KIIT-IEEE Student branch council invites all enthusiastic techno-geeks to come broaden their horizon on the wide field of science this KIITFEST 2018.</p>
            <p>The world is quickly adopting to electric vehicles and in the next couple of decades, EVs are going to be more mainstream than internal combustion vehicles. More automotive manufacturers are now devoting a rather large chunk of their resources towards the research and development of electric vehicles. This begs a question though! Where does India fit in the overall scheme of electric vehicles globally? The government of India had a plan of converting the entire fleet of vehicles to fully electric by 2030, which is barely 12 years away. But in January, 2018, it was sort of scrapped. If this actually happens, then India will be one of the largest markets for electric vehicles in the world, possibly only behind China.</p>
            <p>This year we welcome you all for a 3-day workshop on electric vehicle and it’s future proposition.</p>
            <p>A certificate from the KIIT-IEEE student branch chapter would be awarded to all the attendees. </p>

   <h1>SEGUIDOR</h1>
   <p> Design and construct an autonomous robot which is capable of traversing the arena by following a line in a particular manner and avoid the obstacle that it might encounter. The participants are required to build a line following bot which is capable of detecting an obstacle in front of it and sense the presence of colour on the floor in front of it. </p>
   <p> TASK: Traverse the area from the START point to the END point by following a black line laid throughout the white area. But the task is not that simple. The bot should be capable of following a particular pattern as mentioned further in this problem statement. The bot should work on the principle of advance line follower to give utmost efficiency on the arena. During its operation, the bot will encounter the various obstacle which it needs to understand and take action accordingly. Performing every task smoothly will result in full point and violating it will result in penalties.</p>
   <p> <b> ARENA DESIGN & SPECIFICATION: </b> </p>
   <ol>
      <li> The arena will be absolutely flat and levelled out so additional power is not required to run the bot. Although participants can vary the speed of their robot to give maximum efficiency in following the line.</li>
      <li> The Surface of the arena will be painted white and the bot is required to follow a black line of thickness 2 centimetres.</li>
   </ol>
   <p> <b> KEY POINTS: </b> </p>
   <p> There are some key points of the arena that the participants need to keep in mind while programming their bot to gain maximum points and avoid deviation from the required path. </p>
   <p> At some point in the area, the black line will not be continuous and there will be a gap of not more than 5 centimetres. There will also be a sharp turn after some gaps. So the participants should program their bot in such a way that it does not malfunction at these given points. According to the given figure, the bot should follow the line as the blue line suggest.</p>
   <p> As the image suggests, at some point of the arena the line shift suddenly to either the right or left by not more than 1 centimetre. The participant needs to program their bot in such a manner that it could understand the shift and traverse the path according to the blue line shown in the image.</p>
   At some points of the arena, the lines will have sharp turns but the edges of the turn will be removed as you can see in the image beside. So the participant needs to program their bot in such a way that it does not malfunction in this part.
   At some points of the arena, the path could have a turn with an angle of at most 45 degrees. So the participants will have to program their bot accordingly. If the bot leaves the path, it will have to restart from the last checkpoint and penalties will be imposed for every such action.
   Some part of the arena will constitute curved dotted lines with gaps of a maximum of 1 centimetre. The line will not bend with a very sharp turn but will almost look like a straight line. So the contestant need not worry so much about this part as they will easily be able to traverse with a minor change in the program.
   <p> <b> COLOUR SENSING:</b></p>
   <p>There will be points in the arena where the line will divert into two paths at 90 degrees. At this point, there will a rectangular patch of red colour laid on the floor 3 cm ahead of the turning point as shown in the diagram. The participant needs to construct their bot and program it in such a manner that it should be able to detect this colour in front of the line and take 90 degrees turn to the left side. Taking a right turn in this point and following the path will result in negative points. If the left path is traversed, the team will gain points in their favour.</p>
   <p>There will be points in the arena where the line will divert into two paths at 90 degrees. At this point, there will a rectangular patch of yellow colour laid on the floor 3 cm ahead of the turning point as shown in the diagram. The participant needs to construct their bot and program it in such a manner that it should be able to detect this colour in front of the line and take 90 degrees right turn. Taking a left turn in this point and following the path will result in negative points. If the right path is traversed, the team will gain points in their favour.</p>
   <p> When patches of blue colour will be present on the floor in front of the line the bot should take a 180 degrees turn clockwise or anticlockwise and follow the path backwards and take another left turn to follow the right path. Skipping the blue patch and following the wrong path will result in negative marking. </p>
   <p> According to the given figure, at some point in the arena, there will be no line to follow. Instead, there will be a wall in front. The participant will have to construct their bot in such a way that it should detect the wall in front of it and take a 90 degree turn to the right and continue to detect a line again. If the bot is not able to detect the wall in front of it or it is deviating from its required path, then it will have to take a restart and start from the last checkpoint with penalties. </p>
   <p> The Arena will contain various checkpoints, completing which will result in additional points. After any checkpoint, if the bot deviates from its path, then the bot will start its journey from the last checkpoint. </p>
   • The contestant will need to program their bot so that it is capable of turning clockwise or counter-clockwise at exactly at the angle required at each key points of the arena. Failing which will result in negative marking.

<h1> MIRROR MAZE 2.0 </h1>
<p> <b> Description: </b> </p>
<p> 
 There will be a maze of size 11x17 sq.ft. where the bot will traverse. The walls will be made of glass and mirrors. It will be a manually controlled bot that can be wired or wireless. The goal is to gather maximum points by touching the blocks, placed randomly across the maze. A camera or a phone should be mounted over the bot, which will provide a live feed fpv from bot. The driver will have to control it through the camera screen as the arena will not be shown to the driver who is controlling the bot. Obstacles like speed breakers, bumps and fluid patches would be present in the arena. The depth of fluid patch would be 2 cm from ground level. So all electrical connections of the bot must be designed accordingly.</p>
<p> <b> Requirements of the bot: </b> </p>
<li> Dimensions of the bot must not exceed 20x20x20 cubic.cm. </li>
<li> All connections of the bot must be minimum of 3-4 cm above the ground level. </li>
<li> Max potential difference between any two points of bot must not exceed 16v. Only 220v AC would be provided. Participants would have to bring their own adapter/battery etc. </li>
<li> No weight criteria. </li>
<li> The camera or mobile phone must be tightly fixed in order to prevent detachment.</li>
<p> <b> Rules and Regulations:- </b> </p>
<li> Maze dimension will be (11x17) sq.ft. </li>
<li> A team of max. 4 participants is allowed. </li>
<li> The event consists of ......... rounds.</li>
 <li> Each team can avail for only 1 technical time-out per round. 
<li> The maze obstacles consist of speed breakers, bumps and may be fluid patches along with few other common obstacles. </li>
<li> Each participant has to start at a fixed position to traverse the maze. </li>
<li> Wooden blocks of certain points would be placed at random positions in the maze before a team start their turn (Red block= 5 points, Blue block= 10 points, Yellow block= 30 points, Jackpot block= 100 points).</li>
 <li> The points will be awarded on a time basis and a total number of blocks touched by the bot.</li> 
<li> Only one person per team will be allowed to manage the wire (only if the bot is wired) & only one would be allowed to control the bot. The other members would be sitting by the controller facing their laptops thereby seeing the live feed. The person managing the wire is strictly prohibited to convey any information regarding the layout & position of point blocks. Anyone doing the same will be disqualified from the event.</li>
<li> The controller would be allowed 30 seconds just before the start of their turn to observe the maze & positions of the point blocks. </li>
<li> Any damage to the arena will result in direct disqualification. </li>
<li> Teams with maximum points qualify for the next round.</li>
<li> Each team gets 3 skip options. It can only be applied when a bot is unable to cross any obstacle or if the controller wishes to skip the obstacle (No negative markings in such criteria). Special case: In case the controller wishes to skip the water(or non-Newtonian fluid) patch 10 points would be deducted from the total score. Any damage to the bot caused while crossing this patch is solely the team’s responsibility. </li>
<li> However, this skip option is not available in the jackpot region.</li>
 <li> Touching the glass wall results in a negative marking of 2 marks. </li>
<li> Further rules of qualifying rounds would be disclosed on spot. </li>
<li> The organiser’s decision is final and binding</li>

<p> <b> Judging Criteria: </b> </p>
<li> A trial case of 50 seconds will be allowed to individual teams to check the maze.</li>
<li> A participant can avail maximum up to 3 skips per round, which can be opted only if the bot freezes on spot. For each skip, 5 marks would be deducted.</li>
<li> All teams would be awarded 50 points initially only if it satisfies the dimension criteria.</li>
<li> A tolerance of 20cm + 4cm (bot width) will be allowed for participating in the event, however, the team would lose the initial 50 points in that case.</li>
<li> There would be a total of 3 rounds: <Round 1> Individual teams would be participating one by one & the top teams scoring the most points in the specified time for the round will get qualified for the next round. 

    <p> <b> Round 2  : </b> Two bots would be participating simultaneously from 2 random extreme points in the maze. The bot securing most points in the given time span of the round qualifies for the next round. An addition of 20 points would be awarded if the bot exits the maze in the given time span. <p> <b> Round 3 :  </b> Will be disclosed on spot. </p>
<p> <ul> <li> Ramming of the wall (by a bot or by the participant) would directly result in a deduction of 10 marks. </li>
<li> Each team is allowed only 1 technical timeout per round and this rule is applicable only if the coordinators find the case to be relevant. </li>
<li> All rules & marking schemes are subjected to change before the starting of competition. </li>

            <p><b>Aircraft Specification:</b></p>
            <p>The aircraft is to be designed in such a way that it travels quickly in air, is easily maneuverable and can carry the maximum payload.</p>
            <p>Gearboxes in Micro Class are allowed. Multiple motors, multiple propellers, propeller shrouds, and ducted fans are allowed.</p>
            <p>Gyroscopic assist or other forms of stability augmentation are not allowed.</p>
            <p>Competing designs are limited to fixed wing aircraft only. No lighter-than-air or rotary wing aircraft such as helicopters will be allowed to compete.</p>
            <p>The payload must consist of a support assembly and payload plates. All payloads carried for score must be carried within the cargo bay(s). The support assembly must be constructed so as to retain the weights as a homogeneous mass.</p>
            <p>The payload should not provide any addition to the strength of the wings and fuselage or any other aerodynamic advantage. e.g. steel rods to strengthen the wings are not allowed.</p>
            <p>Usage of Ready-to-Fly (RTF) and Almost-Ready-to-Fly (ARF) kits is strictly prohibited.</p>
            <p>Any dimension of the aircraft should not exceed 1000 mm i.e. maximum allowed dimension is 100cm, whether it is the wingspan or the length of the aircraft. Any exception to this rule will render the participant disqualified.</p>
            <p>Metal propellers are not allowed.</p>
            <p>Anyone found not following the above rules will be disqualified.</p>
            <p><b>Launching method:</b></p>
            <p>Aircraft may be launched by firmly grasping the fuselage and using a one-step (stride) launch. Only one person may be used to hand launch the aircraft.</p>
            <p><b>Take off:</b></p>
            <p>After the signal from the respective AERIAL QUEST representative, the team will have only 2 min to prepare their respective UAV and take off. Two attempts will be given for the round.</p>
            <p><b>Landing:</b></p>
            <p>Landing is defined as occurring from initial touchdown to the point at which the aircraft stops moving. A crash-landing invalidates the landing attempt and the round. A good landing for a successful flight is defined as touching down within the designated landing zone. Rolling-out or sliding beyond the landing zone limits is allowed, provided the aircraft initial touchdown occurs within the landing zone.</p>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>The participant will be considered for scoring only if his plane follows the mentioned path. Otherwise, his score stands at zero.
                <li>The competition will be held for only one. Two chances will be given for each round, only if the plane lands before the first cone or if it fails to launch. If the plane crosses the first pole, no second chance will be awarded for that round.
                <li>All parts must remain attached to the aircraft during flight and landing.
                <li>Broken propellers are allowed, and will not invalidate a flight attempt.
                <li>The payload must be secured to the airframe to ensure that the payload will not shift or come loose in flight.
                <li>The use of 2.4 GHz radio is required for all aircraft competing.    
                <li>A maximum time of 3 minutes will be given to complete the circuit.
                <li>The weight of payload and empty weight of the plane will be checked by the coordinator after every round.
            </ol>
            <p><b>Judging Criteria:</b></p>
            <p>Score = (N÷2)+1/((T∕W  )t )+LP + PF, where</p>
            <p>N = No. of rounds.</p>
            <p>T/W = Net thrust: Weight Ratio.</p>
            <p>t = Time taken to complete.</p>
            <p>LP = Landing Point.</p>
            <p>PF= Payload Fraction</p>

<hr>
<p><b>Description of the event:-</b></p>
<p> Being an architect can be both fun and tough. The Architecture of Destruction has been a very popular event of KIITFEST since its inception, and this year it is ready to have fun with some "destructively creative" minds. Divided into three rounds, this event checks your ability to find the weak spots of a structure, your ability to create trouble for your opponents with your steps, and your ability to make a rock-solid structure with limited resources. Stay calm, and win it all. </p>
<p><b>Rules and Regulations</b></p>
<p><b>1. BREAK UP(KNOCK OUT ROUND)</b></p>
<p>  2 teams will be pitted against each other. There will be a pile of Jenga blocks and you have to pull the blocks. Make sure to make your opponent the victim of your move.</p>
<p><b>2. SHOW ME YOUR MOVE BABY!</b></p>
<p>In the second round, Participants will have to make a structure of their own using the JENGA blocks. During the event, one member of the opponent will be allowed to come and pull out or add one block in their structure. </p>
<p><b>3. THE TWIN TOWERS OF 9/11</b></p>
<p>After 2 rounds of Jenga, the final round will involve a pack of cards. Since childhood, we are building castles of cards. Again we need to make 1.
You'll be given a pack of cards. And you have to make a Castle out if it(make sure no card is wasted). Then, the opponent will be given 5 paper Planes and they'll throw it on your castle. It involves your precision and your opponents' aim. Time factor involved as well as strength. </p>

<p><b>Judging Criteria:-</b></p>
<p><ol>
<li>Participant has to be a college student (any branch or year).

<li> Any kind of violence (physical/verbal) is not allowed. If found guilty, the participant will be immediately disqualified. 

<li> Within the event, there might be some instances when the participant will get a chance to destruct others participant's structure. That has to be done only under the eyes of coordinator and within the rules specified at that moment. 

<li> Coordinators have the right to disqualify you at any moment if they find you involved in any kind of cheating or abuse of rules.

<h1>HYDRO BOOSTER</h1>
<hr>
<p><b> DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT</b></p>
<p>Take your first big step to propel yourself into the world of aerodynamics!
Design a water rocket that is completely powered by the thrust delivered by water expelled at high pressure along with its launchpad.
Water Rocket is a mechanical event that involves the fabrication of a rocket whose fuel/thrust for flight is obtained by the use of water that is expelled at a large air pressure. It is an example of Newton's third law of motion. The prerequisites for such an event would be a basic knowledge of fabrication, materials and physical calculations involving thrust, air pressure, etc. The event tests a couple of aspects of the Rocket’s flight. These include range, time of flight and accuracy of the launching mechanism.</p>
<p>The event consists of two rounds. First one is eliminatory, second is the final round.</p>
<p>• First round: Range test</p>
<p>Here the maximum range is tested. The distance between the launch pad and the point of landing is measured and taken to be the points in that round. From this, top 5 will be shortlisted for the next round.</p>
<p>• Second round: Accuracy test</p>
<p>At a distance of 70m from the launch pad, a target is placed. Target contains concentric circles of radii 2m, 4m and 6m. If the rocket lands at the centre, team gets 100 points, second ring 75 points, and outer ring 50 points. If otherwise, no points are awarded. Three teams will qualify for the final round. In the case of any tie, the time of flight will be noted and the team with the least time gets into lead. </p>


<p><b>RULES AND REGULATIONS</b></p>
<p><ol>Max 5 participants. These Participants can be from different colleges too.
<li> The rocket and its components must be handmade. No readymade rocket is allowed.
<li> The rocket body should be made only with plastic bottles of aerated soft drinks of maximum capacity 2.5L and should be free of any fabrication failures or dents caused by heat exposure. More than one bottle can be used but the total volume must be less than 2.5L.
<li>Each team MUST have their own launch pads.
<li> The water rocket must use only compressed atmospheric air as its source of energy. Pressure compressors (foot pump) shall be provided at the venue. The pressure inside the container (rocket body) before launch should NOT exceed 60 psi for the first two rounds.
<li> Water to be filled in the rockets will be provided by the organizers. Calculations regarding amount of water to be used is left to the choice of the team.
<li> Two trials will be given to each team and best of two will be taken into consideration.
<li> The rocket must be launched from a stationary position using a fixed launch pad. Slingshots, trebuchets, catapults, cannons, and all other devices that may assist launching are strictly prohibited. IN other words, the internal pressure of the rocket must be the only source of energy for the rocket.
<li> Water rockets can have multiple stages. Parachute, gliding mechanisms are permitted.
<li> Use of electronic components and chemical explosives are banned.
<li> The point where the rocket hits the ground first will be taken as the point of landing and measurements will be taken considering this point.
<li> Teams are advised to get more than one water rocket, in case of any damage to one. But the water rockets must be identical.
<li> The participants are allowed to use variations of their water rockets in different rounds. However, only one design must be maintained throughout a single round.
<li> The team will be disqualified/given another chance to remodel if the model is found to be dangerous in anyway. Decision of the organizers is final and binding.
</ol> 
</p>
<p><b>JUDGING CRITERIA:</b></p>
<p>The judgment is completely based on the marking scheme mentioned in the event format.
· The organizers decide to permit the launching of the rocket after inspection of both the rocket and launch pad considering factors such as safety and permissible mechanisms mentioned in the rules. In such cases, the organizers’ decision is final and binding.</p>
